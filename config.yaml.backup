# ASSIGNMENT COMPLIANT CONFIGURATION
# =====================================
# Based on: Python AI Researcher Assignment
# Performance Targets:
#   - >95% deliveries completed (2 points)
#   - <500 collisions during training
#   - <20 steps per delivery
#   - Total step budget: 1,500

environment:
  grid_size: 5
  num_agents: 4
  max_steps: 1500        # CRITICAL: Assignment requirement
  max_collisions: 4      # CRITICAL: Assignment requirement

# REVISED REWARD STRUCTURE
# Goal: Encourage efficiency, penalize collisions heavily
rewards:
  pickup: 1.0          # Modest reward for pickup
  delivery: 10.0       # Good reward for successful delivery
  step: -0.1           # Small penalty to encourage speed
  collision: -10.0     # HEAVY penalty (only 4 allowed!)
  progress_closer: 0.5 # Reward for moving toward target
  progress_away: -0.5  # Penalty for moving away
